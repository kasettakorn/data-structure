## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is essential for every programmer. This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of commonly used data structures and algorithms in C++.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are implemented in this repository:

- [Array](data_structures/array.cpp)
- [Linked List](data_structures/linked_list.cpp)
- [Stack](data_structures/stack.cpp)
- [Queue](data_structures/queue.cpp)
- [Binary Tree](data_structures/binary_tree.cpp)

Each data structure is implemented with appropriate methods for insertion, deletion, traversal, and other relevant operations.

## Usage

You can clone this repository and compile the C++ files using a C++ compiler such as `g++`. For example:

```bash
g++ -o array data_structures/array.cpp
./array
```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any bugs or want to add more data structures or algorithms, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
